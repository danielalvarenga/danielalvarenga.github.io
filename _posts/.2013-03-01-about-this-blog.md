description: How to blog like a hacker, or, why did I made this blog ?

I made this blog when I find out about Jekyll and it's awesome integration with Github.

With Jekyll, all I have to do is to create a new .md file (markdown is a file extension widely used for README in Github), write my post and then push it to Github. 

And if that wasn't cool enough, I can also write my blog posts using my beloved Vim and push it to github using the Fugitive plugin, a Git wrapper for Vim.

So I can basically open up Vim, write my post and publish it, all in one place. How cool is that ?
